# Linux File System 101: What You Need to Know

Starting with Linux? Understanding the file system is your first step. Here's what I learned in simple terms.

## What's a File System?

A file system controls how your data is stored and found. Without it, your hard drive would be one giant mess with no way to tell where one file ends and another begins. It organizes data into named pieces (files) so you can find what you need.

Fun fact: The term "file system" originally described organizing paper documents before computers existed!

## The Linux Philosophy: Everything is a File

Here's something unique about Linux: **everything is treated as a file**. Your USB stick? It's a file. Your keyboard? Also a file. Even folders (called directories) are special files. If it's not a file, it's a process running on your system.

## How Linux Organizes Files

Linux uses a **tree structure** (upside-down). At the top is the root directory, shown as `/`. Everything else branches down from there—like a family tree.

**Quick note:** "Directory" and "folder" mean the same thing. Directory is the technical term; folder is the visual name you see in file managers. Use whichever you prefer!

The **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)** defines where different types of files should live, keeping Linux systems consistent.

## Linux vs. Windows: The Big Difference

**Windows:** Multiple drive letters (C:, D:, E:) acting as separate trees.

**Linux:** One single tree starting at `/`. Everything lives under this root.

## What is Mounting?

When you plug in a USB drive in Windows, it gets a new drive letter. In Linux, it gets **mounted**—attached to a folder in the existing tree. This folder is called a **mount point**.

Most modern Linux systems auto-mount USB drives to locations like `/media/username/drivename`. You can see all mounted drives with the command `df -h`.

No drive letters needed—everything integrates into one unified system.

## Try It Yourself

Open your terminal and type `ls /` to see the root directory contents. That's where your entire file system begins!

**Quick Recap:**
- File systems organize data into named, manageable pieces
- In Linux, everything is a file (devices, directories, etc.)
- One tree structure starting at `/` (root directory)
- New drives are "mounted" to folders, not assigned drive letters
- The FHS keeps things consistent across Linux distributions
