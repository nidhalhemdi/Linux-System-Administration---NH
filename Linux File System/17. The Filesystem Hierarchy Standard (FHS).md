# Understanding the Linux File System: A Directory Guide

The Linux File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS), maintained by the Linux Foundation, defines how directories are organized. Here's your practical guide to what each directory does.

## The Main Directories Explained

**`/bin`** - Basic commands everyone can use
Contains essential tools like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`. These are the everyday commands available to all users for copying, moving, and managing files.

**`/sbin`** - System admin tools (the "s" means super user)
Holds commands like `ifconfig` (network configuration) and `fdisk` (disk management). Only administrators typically use these.

**`/boot`** - System startup files
Contains everything needed to start your computer. Don't touch this unless you know what you're doing!

**`/home`** - User personal folders
Each user gets their own folder here. If your username is "john", your home is `/home/john`. The `~` symbol is a shortcut for your home directory.

**`/root`** - Administrator's home
The root user's home directory lives separately at `/root`, not under `/home`.

**`/dev`** - Device files
Contains files representing hardware devices like hard disks and partitions. Remember: in Linux, everything is a file! For example, `/dev/sda1` represents your first disk partition.

**`/etc`** - System configuration files
The name literally meant "etcetera" in early Unix—a catch-all for system files. Today, it holds all system-wide settings: user accounts, passwords, network configuration, and application settings. Always backup this directory before making changes!

**`/lib`** - Shared libraries
Contains code libraries used by applications. Your package manager handles this automatically when you install or update software.

**`/media`** - Removable storage
When you plug in a USB drive or external hard disk, it automatically appears here for easy access.

**`/mnt`** - Manual mount point
An older directory for mounting drives. Still useful when you need to quickly mount a partition temporarily.

**`/tmp`** - Temporary files
Apps store temporary files here. Files can be deleted anytime without warning, so don't store anything important here!

**`/proc`** - System information (virtual)
A virtual directory created on-the-fly with hardware and system info. Want CPU details? Run `cat /proc/cpuinfo`. Need memory info? Try `cat /proc/meminfo`.

**`/sys`** - Device and driver info
Contains information about devices, drivers, and kernel features. You rarely interact with this directly.

**`/srv`** - Server data
Stores data for server applications. Not commonly used on desktop systems.

**`/run`** - Runtime data
A temporary filesystem stored in RAM that disappears when you reboot. Used by system processes.

**`/usr`** - User programs and data
Originally meant for user home directories, but now contains program binaries, libraries, and documentation. On many distributions, `/bin` and `/sbin` actually link to `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.

**`/var`** - Variable files
Stores files that change frequently, especially logs. System logs track events like login attempts. Example: `cat /var/log/auth.log` shows authentication activity.

## Quick Tips

- Check any directory contents with `ls /directory-name`
- Open the graphical file manager, go to "Other Locations" → "Computer" to browse visually
- Different distributions might have slight variations, but these core directories remain consistent
- The `~` symbol always means your home directory

Understanding these directories is fundamental to navigating and managing any Linux system. Take time to explore them—just be careful with system directories like `/etc` and `/boot`!
